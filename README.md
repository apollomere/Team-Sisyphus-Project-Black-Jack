# Team-Sisyphus-Project-Black-Jack
Black-Jack game, incorporating elements from real life black-jack, only digital.

Code will be built in blocks, with each block containing code for one of the smart goals in the design doc.
All blocks should have comments describing variables used in the block, and variables referenced with pointers. 
Comments should be updated as blocks change to reflect the blocks asssociations(functions, structs, or by having code moved or removed).

Block1: Code for deck and dealing cards randomly. 
- Cards are either removed from deck, or we can setup a check for if a card has already been dealt.


How to Run:

Main located in the File located in card.c

1.Download This Repository

2. Run  gcc card.c -o card.exe in command line to make an executable

3. NOTE: Ensure the directory is set to the proper file path for compilation!
