# Team-Sisyphus-Project-Black-Jack
Black-Jack game, incorporating elements from real life black-jack, only digital.

Code will be built in blocks, with each block containing code for one of the smart goals in the design doc.
All blocks should have comments describing variables used in the block, and variables referenced with pointers. 
Comments should be updated as blocks change to reflect the blocks asssociations(functions, structs, or by having code moved or removed).
